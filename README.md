Examples done in class for CS 4413

## formtest
This project has some examples of form-handling, with progressively more
complicated methods of registration handling (registration1.php - registration7.php).  

The project also introduces objects to hold the data from forms
(User and UserData) so that we can fill the form with old values when there is
an error.  

Finally, the project introduces the idea of internationalization by providing
a Message class and a text file (errors_English.txt) that contains errors.

## mvcdemo
This project is has the very stripped down structure of model-view-controller.
We will modify it in class.  

## mvctest
This holds a working MVC project with central controller and URL rewriting.
